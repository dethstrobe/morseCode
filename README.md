# morseCode
A simple morse code app

This was built using the yeoman angular-fullstack.

If you wish to run this, you'll need to install;

MongoDB http://www.mongodb.org/
GruntJS http://gruntjs.com/
NodeJS http://nodejs.org/

To run you'll need to start the Mango Database by typing "mongod" into a command line, like terminal for mac.

Then you'll need to open a new process, navigate to to the directory holding the files. And run the grunt with "grunt serve"

If you wish to edit or add to this, I'd recommend installing Yeoman http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html
